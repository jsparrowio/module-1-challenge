UofM/edX Coding Bootcamp - Challenge 1

## Description

This was the first of many challenges we will complete for the UofM/edX Full Stack Flex Coding Bootcamp. It was completed to practice our skills with writting accessible web pages and semantic HTML elements. It was also used to practice condensing, streamlining, and simplifying code to ensure we are writing DRY code that can be easily updated at a later date.

## Usage

No specific usage intended. Only used as an example page to help practice our skills with writting accessible web pages and semantic HTML elements, and to practice condensing, streamlining, and simplifying code to ensure we are writing DRY code that can be easily updated at a later date.
